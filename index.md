# Georeferencing Historical Maps

This workshop offers an introduction to georeferencing historical maps with QGIS. We will begin by exploring Koerner Library's physical map collection. The Hands On portion of the workshop will guide you through georeferencing a scanned historical map of Vancouver. By the end of the workshop you will be able to:

- Understand the essential concepts and steps for georeferencing a digitized historical map    
- Demonstrate the georeferencing process using a desktop GIS software    
- Calculate and evaluate errors involved with transforming a paper map into GIS data    
- Formulate ideas for further using georeferenced maps with modern spatial data    

    
## Prerequisites
Before attending this workshop we recommend you establish basic familiarity with the QGIS Interface. Check out the Library's [Map Production with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-qgis/) for a gentle introduction.

Georeferencing historical maps requires you download QGIS before the workshop. QGIS can be downloaded from [qgis.org's Downloads page](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). In most cases, you'll want to download and install the **Long term release** instead of the latest release. This will give you most of the functionality you'll need, without encountering the software bugs of newly released versions.
