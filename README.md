### UBC Library Research Commons

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the essential concepts and steps for georeferencing a scanned paper map
- Demonstrate the georeferencing process using a desktop GIS software
- Calculate and evaluate errors involved with transforming a paper map into GIS data
- Formulate ideas for further using georeferneced maps with modern spatial data

### WS Development Questions 
- What map to georefernce and why? Historical maps of vancouver are nice!
- Who is our audience? How to integrate interest groups (historical maps; gis georeferencing)


## Potential WS Sections
- Browse Map Collection
- What is Georeferencing
- Why georeference
  * to add maps to database and make query-able by location or attribute data
  * add as basemap
  * compare place names etc.
  * trace and create shapefiles for spatial (or spatiotemporal) analysis
  * example of landsurvey (also useful for qgis workflow)
- Hands On
  * Introduce a map
  * overview of QGIS workflow
  * Discuss projections (GCS)
  * Georeferencing Considerations
      * strategies
      * virtual layers
