Adjust the transparency of the modified layer from Properties to assess how accurately it was georeferenced. 

This will help adjust symbology to make modified a bit transparent... 
(right click in layers, open properties --> transparency )

note we didnt focus on shoreline but lined up bc projection guess was likely already projected. 

more diffiuclt with not project... can discuss in next setps.
