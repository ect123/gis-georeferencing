# Open Georeferencer and Load Source Layer

<br>

Open the Georeferencer tool from the Layers menu at the top of your screen.

<br>

Load the source layer by navigating to the **gis-georeferencing-workshop** folder and selecting **vancouver-school-map-1975.tif**. A raster is a file datatype where 
values are stored in pixel grids. Images are treated as rasters by GIS.

The Georeferencer window has its own toolbar. Take a minute to hover over each icon to learn what they do. The Zoom and Pan buttons work the same as those on the main QGIS interface.
