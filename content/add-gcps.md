# Begin Georeferencing! 

<!-- ## Add GCP Points -->

You are now ready to begin georeferencing by adding Ground Control Points (GCPs).

<br>     
Choose your first GCP on the historical map. Once you select a GCP on Source Layer from the Georeferencer window, a dialogue box will open prompting you to Enter Map Coordinates on the Target Layer. Choose to do this from **From Map Canvas**. The QGIS Map Canvas will come to the forefront of your screen and your cursor will turn into a crosshair. Click the corresponding GCP on the Map Canvas.

If you need to zoom or pan on the Map Canvas, you will have to re-click "From Map Canvas" from the Enter Map Coordinates dialogue box. If the dialogue box is no longer visible, it is likely hiding behind your current window.

<br>
Once you have have matched a GCP on the Target Layer, the Georeferencer Window will jump back to the forefront. If you are content with your selection, click OK.

You should now see your first point added to the GCP table in the Georeferencer Window.
