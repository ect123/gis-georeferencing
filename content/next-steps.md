# Next Steps

## Where to find Target Layers 
- [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) provides free and open source geospatial data for world geographic features at three scales. 
- Download [Open street map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/49.2492/-123.0149&layers=T) from online or through QGIS with Quick Map Services plugin
- [Administrative Boundary files for Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21)
- [BC Municipalities](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc/resource/0bd8e3d1-4d7f-4db8-a8b2-2cd4cd051074)


## For further practice georeferencing with GIS
- [QGIS Documentation lesson on georeferencing](https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/training_manual/forestry/map_georeferencing.html)
- [UMass Amherst Workshop on Georeferencing a Historical Map](https://umass-gis.github.io/workshops/content/georeferencing/)
- [Georeferencing with ArcGIS](https://www.pbcgis.com/georeferencing/)


## Finding Historical Maps
- [David Rumsey Map Collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/)
- [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/)
- [Maps and Atlases at UBC](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/maps-atlases/finding-maps) - Most of the UBC Library print map collection, as well as atlases and gazetteers, can be found on Level 2 of Koerner Library

## Other kinds of georeferencing
- [geoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/)
- [IIIF](https://iiif.io/)
- [Creating Map Tiles with GDAL](https://github.com/ect123/gdal2tiles-workshop)
