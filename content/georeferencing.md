## What is Georeferencing
Georeferencing appends coordinate information to non-spatial data, such as images.  
While historical maps represent a place and trace geographic features such as roads, rivers, buildings, cities, and political boundaries, cannot be read by a Geographic Information System (GIS) because the locational data for these features is not stored in a manner legible to the GIS––latitude/longitude coordinate pairs. Georeferencing uses Ground Control Points (GCPs) to warp an image to the reference of a known geospatial file.  (edit; elaborate)

Georeferencing is not geocoding. Geocoding is when you have a tabular dataset with street addresses and you use a GIS to geolocate the data as coordinate points.  

## Ways to georeference
- 
- 
- This workshop will use a GIS to georeference an already scanned map from UBC Library's historical map and atlas collection. The Hands On portion of the workshop will guide you through this workflow in greater detail. 

## Why georeference?

* to add maps to database and make query-able by location or attribute data
add as basemap    
* comparisons 
* trace and create shapefiles for spatial (or spatiotemporal) analysis
