# Scanning Maps

UBC students, faculty, and staff can scan paper maps from the Koerner Library map collection using a large-format colour scanner. There is no charge for scanning maps, but UBC Library does reserve the right to deny scans of certain material, including maps in deteriorating physical condition.To ensure that scans are allowed to be used further in publication, research, or other modes of sharing, please contact [Copyright Services](https://copyright.ubc.ca/).

The scanner is available to use on an appointment basis. Please email the library for more information or to schedule an appointment at <library.gis@ubc.ca>.

Materials from RBSC may also be scanned at RBSC’s discretion, and likely at a cost. Scans larger than 11″ x 17″ need to be referred to other UBC Library departments where different fees may apply. A cost estimate can be provided before proceeding. Contact <rare.books@ubc.ca> for more information.
