# Map Collections at UBC Library


Several libraries at UBC hold map collections, including Koerner Library (the main map library), Rare Books and Special Collections, UBC Archives, Xwi7xwa Library, and UBC Okanagan. Each map collection is located based on the topic of the map and its relation to the other collections held in the library. The collection totals ~800,000 paper map sheets, as well as several digital map collections. For more detailed information read the [UBC Library Maps and Atlases Guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/maps-atlases).

Map collection materials are for library use only and cannot be taken out of the library. However, if you want to use a map for a georeferencing project you may scan it. Read more about scanning services at UBC Library in the following subpage.
    

## Rare Books and Special Collections
For most maps created **prior to 1900** check out [Rare Books and Special Collections (RBSC) at UBC Library](https://rbsc.library.ubc.ca/). Their collection of cartographic archives and historical maps is especially strong in pre-1800 world/hemispheres, pre-1900 North America and the Pacific Rim, the Canadian Arctic, fire insurance plans of B.C. towns and cities, and [Tokugawa / Edo Period Japan](https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/tokugawa).

You can read more about the collections at RBSC on their [Historical Map Collection Guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/historicalmaps). RBSC is a closed stack collection which means the materials have to be requested. You can use the map search tips below to find materials, and contact RBSC to view them.

    

## X̱wi7x̱wa Library
[X̱wi7x̱wa Library](https://xwi7xwa.library.ubc.ca/) is a centre for academic and community Indigenous scholarship at UBC whose collections and services reflect Indigenous approaches to teaching, learning, and research. There is a small number of maps located at X̱wi7x̱wa Library created from Indigenous perspectives or relevant to research on Indigenous topics, including treaty maps, Indigenous place name maps, language maps, traditional land use maps, and territory maps. You can read more about Indigenous mapping and mapping resources [X̱wi7x̱wa Library's Indigenous Mapping guide](https://guides.library.ubc.ca/indigenousmaps). Some maps relevant to Indigenous topics are also located at RBSC and Koerner Library.
