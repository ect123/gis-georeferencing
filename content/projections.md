# Choose a Projection

When setting the CRS for your QGSI project, it's important to think about both the projection of your Source Layer and the projection of your Target Layer. Generally, you want to set project's projection to the projection you want your map georeferenced in. The best projection will depend on many factors, including the scale and area the map covers, and whether you want to preserve properties of size, angle, distance or direction. If your Source Layer appears to be projected, it's useful to do some research to deduce the CRS. 

Setting the project CRS doesn't change the CRS of each layer, only how they are rendered/projected 'on the fly' - all to match. 


This map was in 1975 - before NAD 83 --> NAD 27 --> UTM Zone 10N.
Projection - Transverse mercator. 

<!-- other data projections - will reproject on fly to match project 
> wgs for open street map
> vancouver open data allwos you to download in wgs or nad 

This workshop focuses on the practical  -->

<!-- how important to know whether your map has projection ///what it is -- and that of your target layers (vancouver open data allwos you to download in wgs or nad --- explain these -  -- downlaod in wgs or else wont be coordinate --) - why does nad not work?   -->
