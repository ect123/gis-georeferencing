# Choose a Projection

Datums and Projections 


Setting project projection to - what projection you want source layer georeferenced with. 

Depending on whether or not map is in projection --> if yes, try to figure out what projection - ask collections director or think - and use that projection

try to be the most accurate (distortion - dept. here, shape want to preserve) - wouldnt do WGS datum because thats for world. 

This map was in 1975 - before NAD 83 --> NAD 27 --> UTM Zone 10N.
Projection - Transverse mercator. 

other data projections - will reproject on fly to match project 
> wgs for open street map
> vancouver open data allwos you to download in wgs or nad 

<!-- how important to know whether your map has projection ///what it is -- and that of your target layers (vancouver open data allwos you to download in wgs or nad --- explain these -  -- downlaod in wgs or else wont be coordinate --) - why does nad not work?   -->
